# 50m Economical Laser Distance Sensor Module - LRF50M3PS
## Introduction
The 50 meter Economical Laser Distance Sensor Module (LRF50M3PS), produced by IADIY, is an advanced version of the LRF20M3PS, it features enhanced laser output and optical sensing design. LRF50M3PS is a cost-effectiveness solution designed for high-precision distance measurement. Despite its affordable, it delivers exceptional accuracy, making it ideal for precise measurements of static objects up to 50 meters. Note that for distances beyond 30 meters, the target reflectance should be above 80%. Strong ambient light will affect the performance of the ranging module, so it is recommended for indoor use.
