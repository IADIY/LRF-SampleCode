# 80/140/200m Dual-Laser Calibration Laser Rangefinder Module - LRFX0M20PD
## Introduction
The 80/140/200m Dual-Laser Calibration Laser Rangefinder Module (LRFX0M20PD), produced by IADIY, is a high-precision laser rangefinder module that use dual-laser calibration design. It can eliminate environmental interference and electronic system errors, and has better stability and accuracy compared to general single-laser rangefinder modules. The dual-laser calibration design has a closed-loop feedback circuit, which can eliminate the feedback problem of open-loop circuits and measurement repetition errors of the module, thus making LRFX0M20PD more advantageous and able to maintain absolute accuracy under different environmental conditions.
